# Web-Dev-Practice
Includes all of the Web development practice I have done so far.
The HTMLCSS folder includes practice projects made while doing codecademy courses, these websites are made with pure html and css as the folder name implies.
The MommyShuttle folder contains demo pages I made for an app called MommyShuttle
The ResponsiveWebsites contains the project from a responsive web development course from udemy. 

More files will be uploaded soon enough, next projects will be made using Django.
